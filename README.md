# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
I created interactive dashboard to track and analyze HR in an organization. Used different types of customized visualization (bar chart, pie chart, donut chart, area chart, slicers, filter,  etc ).  The objective is to help an organization to improve employee performance and improve retention by creating a HR Analytics dashboard.
